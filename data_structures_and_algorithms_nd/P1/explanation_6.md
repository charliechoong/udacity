Since this involves union and intersection operations, it's useful to utilise actual set operations, by collecting the
data into 2 sets and perform ops on them. Then create new linked list based on this data.
Time complexity is O(n) as there are two loops through the linked lists.
Space complexity is O(n) as it involves 2 sets containing n elements each.
